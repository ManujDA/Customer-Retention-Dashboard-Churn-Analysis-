# Customer Retention Dashboard
This project showcases a comprehensive Power BI dashboard designed for a telecom retention manager. The dashboard aims to identify customers at risk of churn and provide actionable insights for retention strategies.

## How to Use the Dashboard
1. Download the Power BI .pbix file from the repository.
2. Open the file in Power BI Desktop.
3. Explore the three key pages of the dashboard:
   - **Key Performance Indicators**: Highlights critical metrics for retention efforts.
   - **Churn Dashboard**: Visualises demographics, account information, and customer services.
   - **Customer Risk Analysis**: Focuses on churn risk and customer characteristics.

## Stakeholder Requirements
The dashboard was developed in response to the following objectives outlined by the telecom retention manager:
- Identify customers at risk of churn before contract termination.
- Implement measures to retain high-risk customers.
- Provide clear and self-explanatory visualisations for management.
- Use data-driven insights to shift from reactive to proactive retention strategies.

## Dashboard Features

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- Increase tech support capacity for Fibre Optic customers and reduce tech tickets per customer to 0.5.
- Boost sales of 1-year and 2-year contracts by 5% each.
- Achieve a yearly 5% increase in automatic payment adoption.

### Dashboard Sections
#### Churn Dashboard
- **Demographics**: Gender, senior citizen status, partner, and dependent proportions.
- **Account Information**: Payment methods, paperless billing, and charges.
- **Services Signed Up**: Internet services, streaming, security, and tech support usage.

#### Customer Risk Analysis
- **Total Customers**: 7,043
- **Churn Rate**: 26.54%
- **Admin Tickets**: 3,632 | **Tech Tickets**: 2,955
- **Visual Analysis**:
  - Churn by internet service (Fibre Optic vs. DSL).
  - Contract types and tenure breakdown.
  - Monthly charges and payment methods.

## Insights
- The customer churn rate last month was 27%, which means that out of 7043 customers, 1869 left the company.
- The length of the contract and the tenure of the customer are key factors in predicting the churn behavior.
- Customers who have a monthly contract and a lower tenure are more likely to switch to other providers.
- Customers who do not have any dependents or partners are more prone to churn than those who do.
- Gender does not seem to have a significant impact on the churn decision. However, senior citizens are less likely to churn than non-senior citizens
- Customers who use Fibre Optic internet service have a higher churn rate than those who use other types of internet service. The payment method also influences the churn decision, with Electronic check being the most common among the churned customers.
- Customers who do not receive services such as Tech Support, Device Protection, and Online Security are more dissatisfied and tend to look for other options.

## Recommendations
The insights derived from the dashboard lead to actionable recommendations:

- Offer incentives for customers to move from month-to-month to longer-term contracts.
- Promote automatic payment methods like bank transfers or credit cards to improve retention rates.
- Focus on fibre optic customers by increasing tech support resources and resolving tickets more efficiently.
- Use segmentation tools to identify and prioritise outreach to high-value and high-risk customers.
- Engage with at-risk customers before their contracts lapse to reduce churn rates.
