# Customer Retention Dashboard
This project showcases a comprehensive Power BI dashboard designed for a telecom retention manager. The dashboard aims to identify customers at risk of churn and provide actionable insights for retention strategies.

## How to Use the Dashboard
1. Download the Power BI .pbix file from the repository.
2. Open the file in Power BI Desktop.
3. Explore the three key pages of the dashboard:
   - **Key Performance Indicators**: Highlights critical metrics for retention efforts.
   - **Churn Dashboard**: Visualises demographics, account information and customer services.
   - **Customer Risk Analysis**: Focuses on churn risk and customer characteristics.

## Stakeholder Requirements
The dashboard was developed in response to the following objectives outlined by the telecom retention manager:
- Identify customers at risk of churn before contract termination.
- Implement measures to retain high-risk customers.
- Provide clear and self-explanatory visualisations for management.
- Use data-driven insights to shift from reactive to proactive retention strategies.

### Customer Risk Analysis
- **Total Customers**: 7,043
- **Churn Rate**: 26.54%
- **Admin Tickets**: 3,632 | **Tech Tickets**: 2,955
- **Visual Analysis**:
  - Churn by internet service (Fibre Optic vs. DSL).
  - Contract types and tenure breakdown.
  - Monthly charges and payment methods.

## Insights
- The churn rate last month was 27%, indicating that 1,869 out of 7,043 customers left the company.
- Key factors influencing churn behavior include the length of the contract and customer tenure. Customers with monthly contracts and shorter tenures are more likely to switch to other providers.
- Individuals without dependents or partners are at a higher risk of churn compared to those with family responsibilities.
- While gender does not significantly impact churn decisions, senior citizens are less likely to churn than non-senior citizens.
- Customers using Fibre Optic internet services exhibit a higher churn rate compared to those using other types of internet services. Additionally, payment methods play a role in churn, with Electronic Check being the most prevalent among those who have left.
- Customers who do not subscribe to services such as Tech Support, Device Protection and Online Security tend to experience greater dissatisfaction, making them more likely to seek alternatives.

## Recommendations
The insights derived from the dashboard lead to these actionable recommendations:
- Offer incentives for customers to move from month-to-month to longer-term contracts.
- Promote automatic payment methods like bank transfers or credit cards to improve retention rates.
- Focus on fibre optic customers by increasing tech support resources and resolving tickets more efficiently.
- Use segmentation tools to identify and prioritise outreach to high-value and high-risk customers.
- Engage with at-risk customers before their contracts lapse to reduce churn rates.
